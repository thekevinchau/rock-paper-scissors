# rock-paper-scissors
A very simple JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors game played through a User Interface
created primarily through JavaScript DOM manipulation. Styled with CSS.

The project begins with creating a header indicating the game being played. Three buttons were created to represent each hand symbol: Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Tied to each button is an image representing each hand symbol. Attached are event listeners that compare the user's input to the computer's input and displays whether the user or computer wins.

There is also a score tracker that stops the entire game when the computer or user hits 5 wins.
